    "# Exploring Ask HN and Show HN Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Hacker News (sometimes abbreviated as HN) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by the investment fund and startup incubator Y Combinator. In general, content that can be submitted is defined as \"anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.\"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News) Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "On this project, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "<br>Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "<br>Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "<br>Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "<br>Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "On our analysis, we will try to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?"

    "As we are working on a csv file from [Hacker News Posts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), we are going to import csv in order to have an access with the reader() method. We are also going to import datetime with an alias of dt since we are going to work with date type of data. We should also note that the dataset was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that didn't receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. This process was done by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) for the purpose of this guided project."

    "<br>In this project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receive the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of engagement a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between 15:00 and 16:00.\n",

    "However, it should be noted that the data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 received the most comments on average."
