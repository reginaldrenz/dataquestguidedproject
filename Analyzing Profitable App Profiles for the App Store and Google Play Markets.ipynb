    "A data analysis is the process of exploring, cleaning and transforming the data into a useable format. In this analysis, we are going to explore the apps on both Apple Store and Google Play Store and see what type of apps are currently attracting users. Most of us uses a smartphone everyday, we used different apps for different purposes.\n",

    "The goal of this analysis is to recommend the type of apps that the developers can work on. In this analysis, we are going to work on exploring the data, cleaning the data, transforming and analyzing the data to come up with a recommendation."

    "As we observed from our analysis, applications such as **Navigation** and **Social Media** are one of the most popular applications. But it will be very hard market to tap due to popular applications on this genre. We can instead focus on **Entertainment** applications as there is a sudden trend and there's a lot of new applications on this genre that became popular such as *Tik-tok*. Since we are going to focus on in-app ads for our revenue, we can combine some feature's from the other genres such as communication by having a chat option on our application. We can also take a feature from the navigation that will enable us to locate nearby users of the application. One thing comes to mind is an application that we can upload photos and other users will be able to rate the photo. Enabling location based, users can see where that photo was taken. By combining multiple genre, we might be able to attract users to use our application. And implementing in-app ads to this application, the users will have to watch an advertisement before they can upload the photos. We can also create a pro version that will cost the user but it will remove in-app ads."
